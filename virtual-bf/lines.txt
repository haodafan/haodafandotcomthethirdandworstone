--- French BF ---

Mon amour ... I wish to take you to Paris! 

You are ma cherie, je t'aime pour toujours 

It has been too long since I've last seen you, mon amour.

I wish to take you on a cruise romantique down la seine. 

Would you like some more wine? 

Mon dieu- Fine, I guess you are ma petite pogchamp, allons-y

--- BF who is dying ---

I... I don't have much time left... I'm glad I got to see... your face again. 

I wish I could hold you in my arms but alas, both my arms have been blown off 

Can you please hold my hand? Yes that severed one over there. 

No? Okay can you hold my face then? I can't feel anything on my face but I'll pretend I can. 

Hey can you do me a favor and chase that vulture away? It's been staring at me for a while now. 

*Cough Cough* really? Fine. I guess you truly are... my little pogchamp... come ... hereee (dies) 

--- BF who thinks he can sing but he can't --- 

You're beautiful! You're beautiful! You're beautiful it's true! 



--- Slack-jawed yokel boyfriend ---

Ya look good in that straw hat, honey! 

Ugh fine, I guess you are ma lil pog champ, c'mere
