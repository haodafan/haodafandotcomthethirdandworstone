Emi: Akira...? Is it true that you have all your memories..?
Akira: Hmm? Yes, that's right. What's this all about?
Emi: I was just wondering... what is it like?

(Akira looks off into the distance, contemplating about her question. Seeing his expression get serious, Emi worries that she might've asked about a sensitive topic.)

Emi: Oh... should I have not asked? 
Akira: No, it's alright, I don't mind. 
Akira: ...It was a little bit here and there. Then as time passed by, more and more memories came. When you have that much information in your head, it's hard to keep yourself together. But in a way, I'm glad I was able to remember who I originally was.
Emi: Ah... I see.

(Emi  grows quiet, growing anxious about her own lack of memories. Akira notices her looking a bit down, and he pats her head.)

Emi: Wha-?
Akira: Don't worry too much about it. According to Ingram, everyone regains their memories in different ways. It'll come back to you in time.
Emi: Mmmm, what...What if I'm not proud of my past self? What if I was an ugly person previously?
Akira: I'm sure that won't be the case. If the past you is anything like the present you, I'm sure she'll be a very charming girl.
