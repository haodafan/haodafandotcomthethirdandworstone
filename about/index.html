                    <h2> Introduction </h2>

                    <p>
                        Oh! Hello! Didn't see you there. I'm Haoda Fan. I'm currently a 3rd year Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo. I love programming, math, maths, music, and making drawings on paint that look like they were made in less than three seconds. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This website contains all kinds of information about me and the stuff I did. Professional content includes my <a href="http://haoda.fan/current-resume.pdf">resume</a>, and <a href="http://haoda.fan/projects">side projects</a>. Unprofessional content includes my <a href="http://haoda.fan/comics">comics</a>! 
                        This entire website is kind of an about me page honestly, so I'm not too sure what I else I should put here. Here is some miscellaneous information about yours truly: 
                    </p>

                    <h2> What are my other (non work/school related) interests? </h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li> <strong> History!</strong> Ask me anything about the World Wars, Napoleon Bonaparte, Julius Caesar, or the Mongols. I also have a bad habit of buying really expensive history books, reading one chapter, then promptly forgetting about it. </li>
                        <li> <strong> Piano!</strong> It's been a while since I've taken actual piano lessons, but I still occasionally play. The only piece I can confidently play though is Mozart's Rondo Alla Turca. Also thank you to all my friends for making PIANO my most endorsed skill on linkedin. I knew I could count on you guys. </li>
                        <li> <strong> Cooking!</strong> I cook a lot on co-op terms. My most famous dish is my Lao Gan Ma noodles which I will bring to your next potluck event. </li>

                    <h2> What is my lame claim to fame? </h2>
                    <ul> 
                        <li> I accumulated over 15k likes/reacts on the facebook group Subtle Asian Traits for my two short comics about asian childhood: 
                            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1932277343535121&set=gm.1589584004510140&type=3&theater&ifg=1"> (1) </a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1928243960605126&set=gm.1583480351787172&type=3&theater&ifg=1"> (2) </a></li>
                        <li> One of my stick figures was featured for about a total of about 5.3 seconds on a laggy video </li>
                        <li> When I was in grade 9, one of my Command and Conquer Generals games was featured on the
                             <a href="https://youtu.be/ND7wOUGxJvo?t=206">BattleCast 5! </a>
                             My ingame name was Cell, I lost, and that video only has like 800 views... But still, I was pretty much a pro gamer at that point. </li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h2> What are some things  I almost accomplished but didn't quite </h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li> I almost did grade 10 piano but decided not to because basic harmony already scarred me enough (I commend anyone who can COMPOSE or even IMPROV music because I for sure can not) </li>
                        <li> I almost made two history related youtube videos until these 
                            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc4MCFrPiUg">two</a> 
                            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH9UhfRKAOc">videos</a> 
                            scooped my subjects and I realized that the video I was making would be no where near as good as theirs :'(</li>
                        <li> I almost went night skiing on mont bromont but when I walked outside I thought it was too cold so I cancelled. I swear I'm not lame btw</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2> Other mildly interesting facts about me and my life in an unordered list </h2> 
                    <ul>
                        <li> I look like a high school student even today in third year. Just last year, people were asking me while I was an orientation leader (a role you had to be at least in 2nd year to be in) if I was an actual student at this university or just volunteering from the local high school.</li>
                        <li> I spent 60 dollars on this domain but it is 1000000% worth because who else can have their last name as a second level domain?? Thanks, dad.</li>
